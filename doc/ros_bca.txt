CLASSES
    BCA
    
    class BCA
     |  This class is responsible for interacting with an HD Camera.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |  
     |  callback_2d_capture(self, data)
     |      Callback method for 2d capture, it subscribed to UVC_Camera raw_image topics
     |      It refresh the image saved in self.cv_image at every callback
     |  
     |  callback_bca(self, data)
     |      Callback method for BCA analysis, it reads BCA_Analysis ROS topics which is
     |      a BCAMsg.msg topic containing bacterial colonies selection specification.
     |      It called colony_selection and saved raw image, analysis image, picking
     |      image and bacterial colonies found parameters to DB.
     |  
     |  colony_selection(self)
     |      colony_selection calls BC_finder methods from bca_cv.py library. Then, It selects
     |      the colony that fits the specifications from ros topics msg.
     |  
     |  listener(self)
     |  
     |  writeImageDB(self, operation, protocol, step, image)
     |      Write image to DB
     |      Args :
     |              - operation : "raw", "picking" or "analysis"

     |              - image : image to write in DB (.jpg filename)
     |  
     |  writeParamsDB(self, operation, protocol, step, parameters)
     |      Write params to DB
     |      Args :
